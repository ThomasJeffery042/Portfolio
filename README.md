# Portfolio
I am a recent graduate from the University of Sheffield who graduated with a 2-1 in Computer Science, this repository is going to be a portfolio of small projects I work on in Python to show my proficiency to recruiters in both Python and Git.


# Plan for repository
The plan for this is to work on three different projects at first in the following order:
1. A program that calculates the collatz conjecture and draws it on a screen showing how the numbers in the sequence are connected.
2. An example of machine learning using look-up to create a connect 4 AI that you can play against.
3. A polished version of my dissertation code (On the subject of automated medical segmentation using Tensorflow and public images of hearts).
